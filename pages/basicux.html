                <p>
                    At the end of this Assignment I learned how to build from scratch an XD prototype of a website. The long term goal was to create a platform for international students who have just arrived in Copenhagen finding either accommodation, a job or a social network.

                <p>
                    To be able to reach our final goal, the recently acquired knowledge on Desk Research came in quite handy. We searched for different sources regarding design, content and functionality. I found it very interesting trying to come up with a solution that was not already too used, meanwhile finding solutions on how to make a XD prototype for the topic. The copy and microcopy was to be provided in order to allow good UX for the target audience. This was definitely a big project where we got to work on style tiles, wire-flows, wireframes, etc.

                <p>
                    It was the first time ever I opened Adobe XD, I found it amazing and it would help me feel a bit frustrated in the future, as my CSS skills would not meet the requirements to create exactly the same as a prototype. I got to understand how useful it is to go from a low to a high fidelity prototype. We used different methods of analyses, where the "Think Aloud Test" proved to be most useful

                    The focus on this assignment was the creation of our first responsive website. We learned several different testing methods and design principles. We went through sketching, writing for the web and designing wireframes, colour schemes, mood-boards and style tiles.

                <p>
                    Being a Graphic Designer, I had a good background with design tools such as Illustrator and Photoshop. As to HTML and CSS, I can't say I was a virgin, but I had seen superficial information about it maybe 5 years before. On the first weeks I learned so many new concepts and terms it felt a bit too much. By the end of this TOPIC, I'm glad I learned a lot about HTML structure, Positioning objects with CSS, Media Queries and Grid/Flex properties.
