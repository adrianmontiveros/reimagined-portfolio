                <p>
                    To make a short <strong>video-story</strong> without any plot-driving words in it; spoken or written. The storytelling had to rely solely on the images.

                    Thinking of a plot that did not excede more than 150 seconds yet kept the audience interested. Learn how Adobe Premiere Pro works.

                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    We were asked to create a <strong>new campaing</strong> for this NGO to fight food waste. The tone of the site had to be educational/inspirational. The content had to be created by our group and we had to follow certain design guide lines given by the brand.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h2>Main Points</h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a <strong>fresh idea</strong> to create an impact in the users. Making sure the content developed was professional and relevant. Editing video, recording videos based on our storyboards. Making sure our content could be displayed in SoMe by making the purpose obvious in the first seconds.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Roles</h2>
                <p>
                    This group was formed after we took the personality tests. So we created the group being one of each type. I got to be the <strong>"generator"</strong>. And it turned out to be quite true, though I did not really believe in the test to start with. Brainstorming and speaking freely came really easy to me, where as I heard "I don't know how to brainstorm" from more than one colleague.

            <h2>Learning Process</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoyed this assignment very much since it was a perfect excuse to go to the Tech Lab and borrow equipment. We worked with the Cannon kits, and it was very exciting giving the videos professional looks without any studio settings. I learned that white paper held in the right position is just as good as any expensive lamps. Working with sound we used "the basement room" to record knives sounds. It was a great experience and I learned how to use Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Audition to edit video and sound. <strong>I think it is also worth mentioning</strong> that this assignment not only taught everyone a lot regarding FOOD. I really hope Foodsharing CPH can use some/any of the content we created as the cause is really noble.
