                <p>
                    The ultimate goal of this assignment was the design of a character and a background. We were asked to use Illustrator to bring them to life, making an animated spriteto use in our site. Some of the steps were finding inspiration for the drawing style and collecting visual elements for a moodboard as well as describing its use in terms of colours, outlines, textures, shapes and other visual elements.

                <p>
                    Using Adobe Illustrator to create our characters and backgrounds. Moving characters (SVG, GIF). Using HTML and CSS to animate our character over the background.

                    Illustrating and animation using layers in Illustrator. Researching inspiration before sketching as a creative explosion, learning how to use new tools and exporting as an .svg in order to create a css-based animation.

                <p>
                    At the end of this Assignment I learned how to build from scratch an XD prototype of a website. The long term goal was to create a platform for international students who have just arrived in Copenhagen finding either accommodation, a job or a social network.

                <h2>Main Points</h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to reach our final goal, the recently acquired knowledge on Desk Research came in quite handy. We searched for different sources regarding design, content and functionality. I found it very interesting trying to come up with a solution that was not already too used, meanwhile finding solutions on how to make a XD prototype for the topic. The copy and microcopy was to be provided in order to allow good UX for the target audience. This was definitely a big project where we got to work on style tiles, wire-flows, wireframes, etc.

                <p>
                    It was the first time ever I opened Adobe XD, I found it amazing and it would help me feel a bit frustrated in the future, as my CSS skills would not meet the requirements to create exactly the same as a prototype. I got to understand how useful it is to go from a low to a high fidelity prototype. We used different methods of analyses, where the "Think Aloud Test" proved to be most useful

                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this assignment was to create a concept for a native app that would help improve KEA's students' social and academic life. This had to be accomplished by choosing a challenge that fulfills a wish or covers a need for students and that will improve the education, studying or study life for the students.

                <h2>Main Points</h2>
                <p>
                    The Design Sprint is a long and complex process. We started by brainstorming ideas, writing down the most relevant ones and disputing those that made no sense. Concept map, sketch, decision process, prototype are some key words. Team Canvas, HMW notes, The Four-step sketch, Crazy 8s, Supervote, “maybe laters”, testing and last but not least, pitching the product.

                <h2>Learning Process</h2>
                <p>
                    This assignment made me learn a lot about my colleagues and about myself. The pace of the assignment was very fast, working in five days with five types of method for each day. I loved using The Quick and Dirty method to create a team, as well as all the brainstorming steps. Working in a big group with a lot of big personalities and creative people where roles are given out for team members is indeed a valuable lesson that shows you exactly what to expect IRL.

            <h2>Roles</h2>
            <p>
                The hardest part of the whole assignment proved to be the taking on roles. My role was not one, but many, as it was very difficult to draw lines between one and the other. On the first days of the sprint we all sketched maps and ideas. Everyone took part in the voting. At the end I played the role of stitcher when high-fidelity prototype was developed and managed to solve inner conflicts in the group by talking about them with the people involved. I want to believe I helped the team mantain the direction by reminding everyone common goals. I was also part of the research team, conducted interviews user testing, and consulted the experts as well. I tried to introduce the <strong><a href="https://exploringyourmind.com/edward-de-bono-six-thinking-hats/">Six Thinking Hats</a></strong> technique by Edward de Bono to help us stay in "the zone", and I use the <strong><a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/7183/the-yes-and-approach-less-ego-more-openness-more-possibility">"Yes, and..."</a></strong> approach which I learned while doing Improv a few years back.
