                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    The ultimate goal of this assignment was the design of a character and a background. We were asked to use Illustrator to bring them to life, making an animated spriteto use in our site. Some of the steps were finding inspiration for the drawing style and collecting visual elements for a moodboard as well as describing its use in terms of colours, outlines, textures, shapes and other visual elements.

                <h2>Main Points</h2>
                <p>
                    Using Adobe Illustrator to create our characters and backgrounds. Moving characters (SVG, GIF). Using HTML and CSS to animate our character over the background.

                <p>
                    Illustrating and animation using layers in Illustrator. Researching inspiration before sketching as a creative explosion, learning how to use new tools and exporting as an .svg in order to create a css-based animation.

                <p>
                    Project Pool is a pool from KEA full of html, css and javascript projects to choose from. The rules are 1. HTML, CSS, JS are equally important. It should look good. It should feel good. It should work. 2. A new partner every day. 3. A new project every day. Don't work on the same with two partners. But show your work, get inspired.

                <p>
                    In teams of two, we chose to make a bubble animation. Through the use of random math in js we managed to create colourful bubbles appear at hover.

            <div>
                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    The planning and creation of an interactive, animated, web-based onboarding sequence that through gamification explains an important aspect about moving to Denmark to be a student of MMD at KEA CPH. In a team of four people, we created a game to help them in the process of adjusting to danish norms. The purpose of the game is to help new arrivals in Denmark to survive the process of obtaining the paperwork needed in order to settle here.

                <h2>Main Points</h2>
                <p>
                    As a recapitulation of "everything-learned-thus-far" we went through all of the topics we saw before: the process of creation, group work, design sprint, storytelling, interactivity, usability, coding, testing and pitching.

                <h2>Learning Process</h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in the group had very different skills and were very eager to try and improve those skills where they felt more challenged. The flow was well organised and everybody had their role. I found that the Kanban chart was very useful and helpful. The storyboard was key in the swift completion of this assignment. My colleague coders were geniuses at Javascript so that set me back a little bit.

            <p>
                My part in this assignment was very much of the researcher and copywrighter. I helped a lot with the animations by venturing into using <strong>Adobe Animate</strong>. This was very interesting and very time consuming. :)
