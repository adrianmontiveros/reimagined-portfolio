                <p>
                    The Goal of this Module was to learn the basic/primary tools as well as introducing the basic terminology within interface design, digital communication, user testing and responsive web design.

                <p>
                    The focus on this assignment was the creation of our first responsive website. We learned several different testing methods and design principles. We went through sketching, writing for the web and designing wireframes, colour schemes, mood-boards and style tiles.

                <p>
                    Being a Graphic Designer, I had a good background with design tools such as Illustrator and Photoshop. As to HTML and CSS, I can't say I was a virgin, but I had seen superficial information about it maybe 5 years before. On the first weeks I learned so many new concepts and terms it felt a bit too much. By the end of this TOPIC, I'm glad I learned a lot about HTML structure, Positioning objects with CSS, Media Queries and Grid/Flex properties.
